title : Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Lennd
---

### Company Description
At Lennd, our Mission is to empower and inspire event teams to create life changing experiences. We are building the operating system for the production world.

As a team of three, we have been working with some of the most notable event organizations in the world (The Enthusiast Network, The Los Angeles Marathon, BWG Live, Gartner, Kaaboo, San Diego Zoo, Wanderlust, etc.) along with key industry experts to fully launch and make our vision a reality.

We are looking for a Full-Stack Engineer who has some "war" stories to tell (midnight pager calls, scaling services to many, etc.). Up for a challenge across the stack? Join us.

* Website: [Lennd](https://www.lennd.com "Lennd")
* Peak under the hood: [Lennd on AngelList](https://angel.co/lennd/ "Lennd on AngelList")
* Location: Downtown San Diego

### Position Description
* Engineer the front-end of some of our core features (Messages, Schedules, Inventory, Dashboards)
* Help architect our Platform API to support new client-side features
* Contribute to our React Native mobile apps (iOS and Android)
* Translate Sketch designs and Invision experiences into code
* Focus on improving performance across the stack, diving deep into DevTools and New Relic

### Required Skills
* You’re a React.js Pro... or you have the guts to become one in a week.
* Demonstrated experience on a product in a production environment
* Experience with REST, WebSockets and web service design
* You've built and supported web servers using node.js, Python, RoR, or another language of your choice
* Thorough understanding of the responsibilities of the platform, database, API, caching layer, proxies, and other web services used in the system

### Your style is our style
* You want to be the best at what you do
* You’re hungry to learn and grow
* You care about quality but you know the fine line between perfection and solving a problem
* You want to build software and experiences that power the world’s largest events, such as the LA Marathon and Coachella
* When asked if something is possible, you respond with “Anything is possible”... and then go learn how to do it
* If your friends were a little tipsy they might say you are “gritty as fuck” (AKA You love a challenge. You like the idea of doing whatever it takes to turnaround a high priority project.)

### "Is there a test?"
There is a development exercise that all candidates are required to complete. If you want to show off and get a head start, the world is your binary oyster: https://github.com/lennd/front-end-developer-exercise
