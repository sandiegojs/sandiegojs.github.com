Hello Javascripters! I'd like to announce a new monthly meeting that we'll be adding to the
sandiego.js family. For the last 8 months, a group of us have been meeting as the
AngularJS - North County San Diego meetup group to talk specifically about Google's Superheroic
Javascript framework. Beginning this month, we'll be retiring the seperate meetup group and
begin meeting monthly as an additional regular meeting for the sandiego.js group.

As you all know, the Javascript community is booming right now with new frameworks and tools
popping up left, right and center. As interest in any specific topic grows, we think it's
best for everyone if we avoid fragmenting the local Javascript community into smaller meetup
groups and instead encourage additional regular or one-off meetings that can leverage the
existing sandiego.js member base.

## Cool, So What's The Format?

The meeting format is informal and has evolved into something in-between the Regular Monthly
Meeting and Hack Night. Each meeting has a topic and someone leading the discussion with some
kind of presentation, but we like to encourage open discussion, comments and questions from
attendees as much as possible.

With as new on the scene as Angular is, a lot of us are still
learning or solidifying understanding of certain concepts so we're trying to foster an
environment where everyone can learn together rather than come to listen to a subject-matter
expert on a topic. We regularly have a good mix of people with a wide range of experience with
Angular, from people deploying apps to production every day, to folks who are just interested
in learning more about Angular and what it's all about.

## Sounds Good, Where Is It?

The meetup started in North County and will continue to meet there. The awesome people at
[WalmartLabs](http://www.walmartlabs.com/) in Carlsbad have offered to host the meeting.
Those of you who attended the Backbone vs Angular talk back in September will be familar with
the venue. Check out the upcoming [meeting details](http://www.meetup.com/sandiegojs/events/174961582/) for a map and directions.

## Who Are You Anyway?

Oh, right. Hi there, I'm Scott. I build web applications with Javascript for a living. I've been
a regular at sandiego.js meetups for awhile now. You may remember me from a talk I did back in
June about hybrid mobile developent with PhoneGap. If you've talked to me after a meeting you'll
probably remember something about a guy going on and on about how awesome Angular is and why
if you're not testing your apps, you're doing it wrong. I took over as the organizer for the North
County AngularJS meetup recently and decided that merging with sandiego.js was the best thing
for the reasons outlined above. I'm excited to join the other great co-organizers and look forward
to helping build this into an even more amazing community.

#### Hope to see you at the meeting!
