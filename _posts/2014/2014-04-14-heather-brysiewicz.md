I am stoked to be working with the other organizers of SanDiego.js as well as all of the wonderful members. I have been a strong supporter and regular attendee of Meetups for a while now and have been anxiously awaiting the opportunity participate.

## Who Am I

I am a recent San Diego transplant from Chicago now living the dream by the beach! My focus is on Ember.js and Node.js but I expand to more than just JavaScript and have been building since longer than I can remember.

## Community

Having been a student organizer for my alma mater's ACM Student Chapter, falling into the Meetup scene after college was a natural fit. I joined the Ember.js Chicago Meetup group and was hooked.

#### Cheers! And see you all at Hack Night!
