## About Us

We're a 2200+ member strong community full of some amazing people who love San Diego.

Sandiego.js was started in 2011 by Patrick Crowley and Kevin Ball and has grown at a fast pace since its inception.
[Zeeto Media](http://www.zeeto.io), [Zesty.io](https://www.zesty.io/) and [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) are our gracious hosts.

If anyone is interested in setting up new topic-focused meetups, please let us know via a [github issue][issues], email, or by poking us on the shoulder at any meetup.
