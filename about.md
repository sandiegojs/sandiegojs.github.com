## About Us

We're a 500+ member strong community full of some amazing people who love San Diego.

Sandiego.js was started in 2011 by Patrick Crowley and Kevin Ball and has grown at a
fast pace since its inception. [3rdSpace][] has been a gracious host for the entire time and
we've had secondary meetups at OneHealth in Solana Beach and Qualcomm offices in Sorrento Valley.

If anyone is interested in setting up new topic-focused meetups, please let us know via a [github issue][issues], email,
or by poking us on the shoulder at any meetup.

### Keep Connected

For general questions or conversation, get in touch with us through our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandiegojs).
