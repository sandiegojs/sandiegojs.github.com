{% include JB/setup %}


San Diego JS is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. We do not tolerate unacceptable behavior of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all San Diego JS spaces, both online and off, including our mailing lists, meetup group, and any location where we are meeting in person. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the San Diego JS organizers.

Some San Diego JS spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they're not appropriate
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "\*hug\*" or "\*backrub\*") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

San Diego JS prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. San Diego JS organizers will not act on complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of San Diego JS, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the San Diego JS organizers at sandiegojs-organizers (at) googlegroups (dot) com. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to San Diego JS spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of San Diego JS outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of unacceptable behavior by San Diego JS members, especially San Diego JS organizers, seriously. This includes unacceptable behavior outside our spaces and unacceptable behavior that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from San Diego JS based on their past behavior, including behavior outside San Diego JS spaces and behavior towards people who are not in San Diego JS.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of San Diego JS members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, San Diego JS organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all San Diego JS spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other San Diego JS members or the general public.
